# About
This is my collection of solutions to a service called the [**daily coding problem**](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/), which is a good practice aid for technical interviews. I guarantee neither the correctness nor ideal complexity for my solutions, as I typically try to solve most of these in 15mins or less. If you want to be sure that you have an optimal solution, I recommend you get a [premium subscription](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/subscribe?) from them.

# Running
The solutions are all implemented in Python 3 and do not use any external libraries.

# Contributing
If you have a simpler/neater or otherwise more efficient solution, feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/NiklasZ/daily-coding-problem/issues) or pull request.
